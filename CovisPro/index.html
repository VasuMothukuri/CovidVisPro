<h1> Multiple COVID-19 waves </h1>

Countries are witnessing mulitple covid waves, prompting governments to adopt strict steps to halt the spread. However, if preventative measures are implemented in accordance with the guidelines, a country may contain the virus's spread. One of the paper analysed the situation of multi wave theory comparing with spanish influenza of 1918.
<br/><br/>

 <cite>According to a research study of multiwave pandemic dynamics the wave structure of the COVID-19 pandemic draws the attention to the inter-wave strolling period. The author of the paper discovered that controlling the number of new infections during the strolling period is necessary to delay the beginning of a future wave. This amounts to imposing social distancing measures and break potential chains of infections after the end of the wave in order to keep 𝑆𝑡 as low as possible. Delaying the next wave is crucial in order to have enough time to realise an effective vaccine campaign. -</cite>

<b>COVID-19 testing and contact tracing</b><br/><br/>
Before seeking a test, it’s important to first know which exact type of test you need. RT-PCR and antigen tests tell you if you have the virus now. ​Antibody tests tell you if you had the virus in the past.<br/><br/>

Remember even if you take a COVID-19 test before traveling, you could still potentially get infected during travel.<br/><br/>

If it is confirmed to be infected with COVID-19, everyone who may have been in contact with you must be identified and informed. Participate in contact tracing to help stop the spread of the virus. We are all safer when COVID-19 is stopped in its tracks.<br/><br/>

To protect yourself and others, we must get vaccinated as soon as it's our turn and continue to keep up COVID-19 protective measures.<br/>

    <b>Molecular test (aka RNA or PCR test)</b>
<br/><br/>
    These diagnostic procedures are thought to be the most sensitive for detecting a current infection, and the findings are quite accurate. 
<br/>
    In most circumstances, a health care practitioner will use a specialised swab to collect mucus from your nose or throat. (Certain molecular tests now utilise saliva, which may be more pleasant for some people.) PCR testing are another name for molecular tests. 
    <br/>
    Tests with a nasopharyngeal swab—the one that penetrates deep into your nose and to the back of your throat—remain the gold standard. 
<br/>
    However, in recent months, at-home test kits that allow users to collect their own sample (mucus or spit) and submit it to a lab for examination have been available. These kits are simple to use and may be less scary than long-swab testing.

    <br/><br/>

    <b>Antigen test (aka rapid test)</b>
    <br/><br/>
Because the turnaround time is substantially faster than that of an RNA test, this form of diagnostic test is commonly referred to as a "rapid test." 
<br/>
It is also less expensive to manufacture. As a result, antigen testing are increasingly being utilised to screen large groups of people, such as at airports. 
<br/>
From a patient's perspective, antigen testing functions similarly to molecular testing. 
<br/>
Doctor will swab the back of your nose or throat to get a sample for testing. Some antigen tests can be conducted immediately in your doctor's office, eliminating the need to visit a lab.

    <br/><br/>
    <b>Antibody test (aka serology test or blood test)</b>
    <br/><br/>
    This test checks for coronavirus antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced by your immune system to combat a foreign intruder, such as a virus. 
<br/>
    Active coronavirus infection cannot be diagnosed with a COVID-19 antibody test. 
<br/>
    All it tells you is whether you've been infected in the past, even if it was months ago. Antibodies are not detected until at least a few days after an infection has begun.

<b>How Vaccines Work?</b> <br/>
SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is an example of an antigen.<br/><br/>

Vaccines are the best way to train our immune system to recognize viruses, or pieces of viruses, called antigens. Our immune system creates antibodies and other defenses to protect us.<br/><br/>

When a vaccinated person is exposed to SARS-CoV-2, their immune system will recognize the viral antigens and spring into action to keep them healthy. There are many different types of vaccines, as seen in the diagram above.
<br/><br/>
<u><b>Types of Vaccine Platforms</b></u><br/>
All vaccine platforms are designed to train our immune system. There are two categories of COVID-19 Vaccines: Component Viral Vaccines and Whole Virus Vaccines.
<br/><br/>
<u><b>Component Viral Vaccines</b></u><br/>

<b>Protein Subunit</b>: Contains isolated and purified viral proteins<br/>
<b>Virus-like Particles (VLP)</b>: Contains viral proteins that mimic the structure of the virus, but no genetic material<br/>
<b>DNA-based and RNA-based</b>: Contains viral genetic material (such as mRNA) which provides the instructions for making viral proteins<br/>
<b>Non-Replicated Viral Vector</b>: Contains viral genetic material packaged inside another harmless virus that cannot copy itself<br/>
<b>Replicating Viral Vector</b>: Contains viral genetic material packaged inside another harmless virus that can copy itself<br/>
<br/>
<u><b>Whole Virus Vaccines</b></u><br/>

<b>Inactivated</b>: Contains copies of the virus that have been killed (inactivated)<br/>
<b>Live-Attenuated</b>: Contains copies of the virus that have been weakened (attenuated)<br/>
